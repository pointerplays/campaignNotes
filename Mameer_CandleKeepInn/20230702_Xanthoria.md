New book. Authored by Xanthoria (f)(druid)

    - Something about a philactory

We find ourselves in a forest, with the air thiccc with spores. It smells mushroomy.

Man (dead) with sprite on his head. Sprite is crying. Wants to know if we are in fact still alive.
Her name is thunderwing.
It appears that after a while fighting whatever was happening to her forest, Xathoria went mad. She too started to create shroom monsters and even experimented with a sprite and faerydragon et al. .

The forest was apparently transformed within a day.

Xanthoria seems to have turned herself into a Lich (or at least tried)

>> Mushroom men and Vrook fight

First corridor:
Xanthoria's old Laboratory
    - Book with recipe for potion of prolonged life

Vision: Woman in a forest made of mushrooms. She wears the holy symbol of Sylvanus. Then, screams.

Second corridor:
Ring of brightly coloured mushrooms of different sizes (3ft to 8ft tall). Air is smelling heavily of mildew.
I was informed that this is a faeryring -> apparently a gateway to the faewild. Usually but according to Thunderwing it's wrong. She said it doesn't lead 'home'.

Third corridor:
Stench of rot. Cages everywhere. Foggy. 2 infected Behir on the ceiling.
Closed door on one side, but droog said he got a really bad feeling once he was approaching it.
Room on the other end has a huge hole like the once we've seen made by those giant worms. Just much bigger.

>> Behir fight

Behind the door is a grotesque garden full of mushrooms and decaying bodies. In the middle is Xanthoria working on something. 

>> Xanthoria fight

After the Lich died it did the usual thing and the Soul. Droog came to the ralization that the filactory was, in fact Thunderwing. After being confronted by this, Thunderwing asked us to burn this lair to the ground, in return she would take her own live. Droog did something and then put the papers on the floor. I go ahead and burn the papers with my Tinderbox. Immediatly we realized that the fire spread quit a lot faster than expected. Once seeing the research burn, Thunderwing sat down on the ground and, seemingly, just seized.

Once we left her grove we found ourselves back in the Candlekeep Inn. We were presented with our rewards (10k Gold per head) and additionally, Svent was giving the key to a Research/Study room.

Fin.
