Alkhazar's thrilling tales - Appendix

Appendix: Some grains of sand fell out of it. The story is about how Alkhazar made friends with a Golem with a Sapphire in a Desert. It appears as if the Golem was looking for the Netherscroll. After reading the Appendix the book turns into a portal that envelopes us. We come to in a desert.

Desert of Anauroch

Hamukai - name of a prince who appears to have been dead for a while. The scroll that the golem is looking for seems to be at the burial site of Hamukai.

Young nomad talked of a cave with drawings of golems. The Nomads agreed to bring us close to the cave, however they also told us that the cave is in purple worm territory.

City of Azumar - Destroyed city - Resting place of Prince Hamukai

On the way to the city of Azumar we come across a Sphinx.

Sphinx Riddle:
>> Forked like a serpent's tongue,
>> I spark the thunder's peal;
>> With every stroke, the storm is wrung
>> Of darkness by my zeal.
>> What am I?

Upon solving the riddle it bestowed upon us >Lightning resistance for 10 days<

Dragonturtle Ogruhl. Bound by magical chains by the wizards from the city of Azumar. The Golem laid his hands on the Dragonturtle and the chains holding it crumble to dust. 

We finally reach the city. All that's been left are ruins, however, in the middle of the city, there is a big fuck off sand cyclon.

When moving toward the cyclone, 3 flaming skulls surrounded us. They seemed fairly confused about where they were or why they were.
