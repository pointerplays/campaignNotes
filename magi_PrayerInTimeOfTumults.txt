I offer my life to the Magi, I pray that They accept it.

I offer my strength to the Magi, I pray that they redress it.

I offer my blood to the Magi, I pray that it quenches Their thirst.

I offer my body on the altar of the battlefield, I pray They grant me a noble death.

I pray for Their protection, as I offer all that I am.
