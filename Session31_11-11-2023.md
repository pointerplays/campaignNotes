Session 31 - 11.11.2023

> On way toward Akhirah
    >> Black smoke in the distance
    >> Night
        >> Kaen and Hati speaking to Lucille
        >> Gate in ancient city of "Shevarra" ("Shevara"? "Cevara"?)
        >> Magical defenses still active
        >> Venka could maybe return Lucille into her Body
        >> Potential deal

> Akhirah
    >> Apparently unrest
    >> House of Izlak was set on fire
    >> Richer man from out of town (from the north) came in a couple of days ago. Wanted to negotiate with Islah. Things went sour. Islah sent his Enforcers after the man. Enforcers not seen since and in the same night Islah's residence went up in flames.
    >> Parley with Izlak: Citra for Vatre (Angelo)
    >> Turns out Vatre is Angelo
    >> Angelo is clearly in agony and tells us to leave

> Next day (still in Akhira)
    >> Back at the temple we find Angelo outside in meditation
    >> He tells us that he too is one of the gods' champions, Loki to be precice (obviously we thought it would be Sol)
    >> He also explains his codition, since he had become Lokis chosen
        >>> His mental state and cognitive ability vary wieldly on a day to day basis
        >>> On his "best" days he becomes a genius, with seemingly a perfect understanding of the universe. However he also becomes unable to feel any and all empathy. Basically his way or the highway kinda thing.
        >>> On his "worst" days, he becomes like we've seen him the night before, completely wracked with guilt over his own actions.
        >>> Today, we seemingly find him at a "happy medium"
        >>> Whenever he is on his "best" days, he will write down his "insights", a lot of times in ways, that he can hardly, or at all, decipher unless he's back at his intellectual best
    >> He explains to us that the local bonfire was indeed his doing
        >>> He came to town on one of his "best" days. He wanted to bargain with Izlak about (!TBD!)
        >>> After Izlak wouldn't just give him what he wanted, he set Izlaks house on fire
    >> We ask if he could put out the fire, which he said he could
    >> We come up with a plan:
        >>> We pretend to fight Angelo making a big spectacle of it (using Kaen's illusions and other spells) with Sorath in hot pursuit
        >>> Fight will happen mostly in the sky over the city, while we also move out of the city where Angelo will pretend to go down
        >>> After that he will skedaddle and we pretend further to have killed him
        >>> We get Citra out of the city and meet up with Angelo again
    >> And we do just that
    >> It seems to have worked, as Izlak gave us the go-ahead to take Citra with us and do to her as we please (urgh)
    >> After we've taken Citra with us, explained to her that she will now be free, asked her to guide to Shevarra, her accepting and us buying equipment and a mount for Citra, we make our way out of town
