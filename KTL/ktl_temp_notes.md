Session 25 - 23.07.2023

> Next day we come across a battle around a Stronghold. It appears that the Stronghold, held by Tyrnea, (or Castle) was attacked by a faction non of us knew (they wield a banner with a white hammer on a green background). Carris mentioned that the unknown faction could be the fairly recently rebels from Dumue. Whatever the case, Tyrnea seems to win, decicively.

> No further complications on the way to Uquir.

> As the city comes into view we realize just how dense this city has to be. It's smaller then Damvers and Aurica, but judging by the traffic at the gate there must be many people inside. What else strikes us are the 2 massive buildings towering over the city. One is the Ziggurat of Marduk the other is the Imperial Palace.

> The bussle in the city can best be described as 'working chaos'.

> We'll be staying at Ali's.

> Ali speaks Muejab (Uqir local tongue)

> House of Wisdom
    >> Apparently a sort of library run by a exclusive society of scholars
    >> Scholarly circle is called "The Madrasah"

> First thing next day we go to the Temple of Marduk. We're just in time to experience morning prayer in the faith of Marduk.

> Slavery in the Basin
    >> Slavery is quiet normal in the Basin
    >> Tyrnea stands out as having the most restrictions
        >> Slaves can only be either born into it or taken in war
        >> Slaves can legally buy their freedom
        >> Slaves can still be traded
        >> Scholars are torn on the issue whether these rules changed things for the better or not
            >> Some argue that the rules, especially the fact that slaves can legally aquire their own freedom, have improved things
            >> The flip-side of this is that this could be one of the reasons why Tyrnea is constantly at war. To secure a steady supply of new slaves

> We were notified by Ali that some Temple people were waiting for us. As we moved downstairs we are greeted by a Temple priest accompanied by 2 Imperial Guards. The priest said that the High priest will not be able to see us for quiet some time. He clearly was shitting his pants. After Nadarr made it clear that the letters are to delivered personally, he excuses himself, all the while wanting to tell us something but not being able to due to his escort. Kaen sends Hue after them. After we get back to the boarding room Hue awaits us at the window. Hue would follow the 3 until they disappeared in the temple. He did also say that he saw many more of these Imperial Guards accompanying priests.

> We would go ahead an scry for Quneton. We see him in a rather utalitarian room. Quenton would speak with someone, however we do not see another Person in the room. The voice would ask him if he got the letters from us. Then wether he has let anything slip. He was supposed to meet with Raheema.

> Second round of scrying on Quenton. We see him in front of an ornate door. He'd knock, apparently not for the first time as the door opened rather quickly. We would see Raheema, eyes red, potentially from crying. Quenton would tell her the same as he has the bodyless voice. She would be a little miffed by the news but would ultimately tell Quenton that he should send us a messenger telling us that the Highpriest will be out on travels for the foreseeable future. She would further say that the Highpriest isn't dead yet and that any news about what happened should not leave temple grounds. Furthermore he was to tell the "scaly monster" to get his grunts out of the temple.

> Looking for Safarat
    >> As we look around in the area specified, Haati would be the first to spot the Minaret
    >> He'd round the rest of us up and bring us to the Minaret. And it truely is just the Minaret left. The main building was apparently burned down.
    >> After Kaen looked for magical residue in the area, and only finding little of it we go ahead and explore further. First the Minaret. Nadarr noted that something looked off with certain proportions and sure enough Kaen would spot a giant fingerprint on the wall.
    >> Old Tiefling man approaches. He asked what we were doing there. He said something about the former owner of the house being called Shani. I asked if that was a nickname for Safarat but Azim would let us know that Safarat is indeed Shani's artists name. However after I mentioned that name he seemed to relax a bit to our presence here. He'd go on to tell us that Shani left the City after the accident. The accident being that some Fabrial blew up, taking the entire house down. Luckily, Shani was traveling when it happened.
    >> Azim couldn't tell us were Shani went but told us here old Apprentice has now a Workshop of her own in the city.
    >> Azim would also go ahead and tell us how Shani built this Minaret. And it was indeed how we suspected, Shani built a clay model of the Minaret and then enlarged it magically.
    >> He told us that we are to send his regards should we find Shani.

> Kaen meeting his son and the aftermath

> FIN

> Post session chess game with my Patron which gave me much to think about. Do my decisions matter, am I only reacting?

Session 26 - 12.08.2023

> Decided to go to the Palace
    >> The General is currently in the field, so we couldn't go in, since the palace guard was not able to properly verify the invitation
    >> As we were about to walk away, the guard would stop us again and ask Voy wether she was with the Viltautas. He'd mention that the Viltautas are currently in the Atasefusca Grove
    >> Voy immediatly turned toward the direction we were given
    >> And indeed, in the Grove, we find a small Tent Town, identified by Voy as clearly being the tents of the Viltautas
    >> The group is very small, apparently. 
    >> Tyrnea, supposedly, does provide very good for the Tribe (food etc.)
    >> The Tyrneans came to the north and collected the Viltautas to bring them down to Uqir via boat, on the order of General Rhazar
    >> Voyager and Mother Stargate confrontation
        >> Stargate being unsure of her own ability to raise to the Challange
        >> Asher being >>very good<< at communicating (aka. not really saying anything to Stargate)
        >> uncertainty of what the Tyrneans have in store with the Tribe

> Tour of the city
    >> The four hexagonal towers I had spotted were part of the old Rulers citadelle. Towers have been converted to docks for Airships. Dome of the central building is made of elderglass
    >> While we were on top of one of the towers we were able to spot a Airship coming in. It sports the Sigil of the Elven Coalition, to be precise the Sigil of the Diplomatic Corps.
    >> And would you believe it. Out comes Kaens special friend: Armand Belthaire.

> Maya's Workshop
    >> Maya seems annoyed but also concerned at the same time
    >> Before Shani left she gave Maya a letter
        >> "I'm sorry, I have to leave the city tonight. Don't worry, I'm not in danger, at least not more than anyone else. Don't come looking for me, you won't find me. If everything goes well I'll be back soon. If not, know that I truly do love you, with all my heart. Shani P.S.: Remember our dinner in Silence!"
        >> Dinner in Silence refers, most likely, to an actual dinner the two had in the month of Silence. They fought over adjustments to the design of the Altar the two built together, Maya made.
        >> Shrine of seven Firmaments located in the northern Marketplace
        >> Shani demanded NO alterations to the design, even threatening to get a different stonemason
    >> Maya also mentioned that Shani did have enemies
    >> She'd also mention that it was rather common for Shani to just disappear for months on end
    >> She turned down an invitation to the Madrasah, which they took not too well
    >> Maya is convinced that the accident in Shanis house was not that, but rather instigated by Shani herself

> Shrine of seven Firmaments
    >> Perfectly resembles the Pantheon Hati and I visited together with Miriel, except that this shows the southern gods
    >> This is a so called "Incarnative Depiction"

> Back to Maya's Workshop
    >> As we made our way back to Maya, we notice that the crowd surrounding us is funneling in the same direction. There is noticeable excitment in the air. Upon asking one of the locals we learn that the army is about to return.
    >> Parade
    >> Scrying on Shani
        >> We actually get a connection
        >> We see her in a tent on a desk. A Fabrial next to her.
        >> After a moment she shudders, exclaiming a quick curse and then touching the Fabrial.
        >> Next moment the scrying connection is broken
    >> We mention to Maya the reason why Shani was so particular about the Altar.
    >> Maya also mentioned that Shani was considered a bit of a Heritic
    >> Shani was a "Deist" - and certainly not a fan of the gods

        >>> His mental state and cognitive ability vary wieldly on a day to day basis
        >>> On his "best" days he becomes a genius, with seemingly a perfect understanding of the universe. However he also becomes unable to feel any and all empathy. Basically his way or the highway kinda thing.
        >>> On his "worst" days, he becomes like we've seen him the night before, completely wracked with guilt over his own actions.
        >>> Today, we seemingly find him at a "happy medium"
        >>> Whenever he is on his "best" days, he will write down his "insights", a lot of times in ways, that he can hardly, or at all, decipher unless he's back at his intellectual best

        >>> We pretend to fight Angelo making a big spectacle of it (using Kaen's illusions and other spells) with Sorath in hot pursuit
        >>> Fight will happen mostly in the sky over the city, while we also move out of the city where Angelo will pretend to go down
        >>> After that he will skedaddle and we pretend further to have killed him
        >>> We get Citra out of the city and meet up with Angelo again
    >> And we do just that
    >> It seems to have worked, as Izlak gave us the go-ahead to take Citra with us and do to her as we please (urgh)
    >> After we've taken Citra with us, explained to her that she will now be free, asked her to guide to Shevarra, her accepting and us buying equipment and a mount for Citra, we make our way out of town

        >>> She would question us regarding why we were being targeted by black dragons

        >>> "Gate" seems to be a form of Fabrial (Gemstone with precious metal wiring etc.)
    >> Order of the broken eye rundown
        >>> Dabbat - M Dragonborn (~3500) - Vampire Cleric of Nergaul

    >> Visit from Sorath's Patreon in the magical Bath through Karis

> Ul'Naab (6th of Harvest)
    >> Saying goodbyes to Venka and Citra
    >> Travelling in Windform toward Shevarra
    >> 4 hours later we find ourselves above Shevarra
    >> We find a small but seemingly aboned Campsite
        >>> Seemingly set up by an archeological/research outfit or something of the kind
        >>> Drawings and Documents about the City itself
        >>> Latest notes state that they believe this structure to be the Mansion and resting place of the Uniter and further research would have to be done on the inside
        >>> Drawing of a Statue or Fresco with description underneath - with a part that they couldn't decipher. But to Sorath it's quiet clear "We are where we must be" in Aziri - the language spoken in her home city Rashir, Avantria
            >>>> Statue apparently in the townsquare

> The Uniters Mansion (6th of Harvest) (MY Mansion)
    >> There was nothing much in the mansion itself
    >> Going down toward the Basement Carris would point out that the door, leading to the basement, seems to be in top notch shape, clearly being cared for by someone. At which point we come clean to her about who is guarding what we're after
    >> In the basement we find a couple of sarcophaguses
        >>> the sargophaguses are decorated in a similar style that I've seen in the upper city of Rashir
    >> A large stone door at the foot of a set of stairs without any obvious mechanism to open
    >> A black door with 5 strings from maybe a lute or a harp. Also sets of notes marked on the door. 
        >>> Before approaching the door Sorath would hear 3 notes played from a string instrument.
        >>> The notes on the door seemed to be missing the last for
        >>> With some help from Kaen and Voyager I was able to remember a song played to me by my Sister on the day of my departure onto adventures with Tolwynn
        >>> I was able to play the melody on the strings of the door
        >>> I find myself back in Rashir, in front of my sister while she's playing this very song to me
        >>> Moments later, I'm back in the basement, standing now in fron of an open door
    >> Beyond the door is a rod of metal suspended in the air within some kind of (clearly magically) contraption
    >> The rod is a lot cooler to the touch than one might expect considering ambient temperature and it's clearly magical, or loaded with magic. Nothing further happens
    >> A set of stairs leads further up. Behind that door we find another sacophagus. Much more ornate then the others, with handles on the lid.
        >>> Opening the lid reveals a mummified body with a black book and, what seems to be, a sword hilt in hands.
        >>> Touching the book gives me the same feeling of intimate familiarity that my own grimoire gives me
        >>> Opening it to the first page reveals the same question that I'd been asked all those years ago.
        >>> Further: <INSERT TEXT HERE>
    >> So, I am the Uniter and I am dead, but also none of these things...
    >> And, of course, I had to load more weight onto my delicate shoulders...
    >> Opening the black door (or the sarcophagus or retrieving the Key) also opened the stone door.
    >> Further down it goes. We find ourselves in a more natural tunnel environment. Clearly the undercity the research team mentioned.
    >> Damaged Glint Construct encounter
    >> Dead Black Company elites
        >>> Arrest warrants plus invitation to Sorath found
    >> Big underground lake with bridge

        >>> A bell rung in the hallway. The Archivar informed us that htat significes a Storm storming around up top and we are to not leave the facility
        >>> Kaen identifies the Fabriel Voy had found in the lab. It appears to have something to do with memories, likely to recall memories.
            >>>> Angelo, after trying the device, would confirm that it was indeed used to show replay someone elses memory
            >>>> The memory currently slotted into the device is of someone called "Hellwalker", standing in Hell, in front of what he calls a "Purpendicularity" - a pool filled with what looks like liquid metal
            >>>> Considering what Hellwaker said in the memory, it seemed like just being in the vinicity of it charged him up
    >> Quicksplit
        >>> Nadarr and Voy in the Arcanists Lab

            >>>> Room resembles a sort of prayer room or small church
            >>>> On one end there is a sarcophagus with Draconic writing on it
            >>>> After Hati tried to get a closer look at the writing (and totally not trying and failing to open it) Sorath went to get the others
            >>>> In the meantime Hati managed to open the sarcophagus
            >>>> Inside lay the remains of a human, wrapped in red cloth
            >>>> Nadarr would translate the text as "Here lies Jerome Wyrmeye - A hero to none - A father to many - A saviour to all - Your burdens become ours"
            >>>> Voyager was able to spot something glimmering betwixt the remains
            >>>> Nadarr would fish the glimmering thing out of the sarcophagus
            >>>> Turns out to be a golden signet ring, very much like the other one we've found, just made of gold and not steel - Carris would confirm that it does appear to be the signet ring of the Drake
    >> Northern Hallway
        >>> Construct fight

            >>>> About some Slavetrader targeted by some other Slavetrader

        >>> Leather bound book apparently outlines the ritual the rift hunters used, or rather the arcane part of it
            >>>> Outside of the Devine part of the ritual we are also missing some other components, a specific fabrial and a "Divine Conduit"
        >>> 741-8-MEMENTO: Memoryshard-0
            >>>> The portal ritual from Jerome's perspective
            >>>> Vision Jerome had during the ritual: "You see a flock of white doves, reddened with blood as they pick away at the carcasses of two giants. You see the sky turn red, then black, then blue. You look upon the tallest tower in the world, and you watch as bodies innumerable fall from the top to their doom. A dead chieftain on a bed of black dahlia petals, surrounded by his kin, each of them wondering what they might gain from this. A raven ate a doe, a stag ate a rabbit, and a rabbit ate a dragon. You see a patient weaver with a skein that never ends. A great door opens but beyond there is nothing but an empty room."

            >>>> He'd immediatly causion us
            >>>> According to the observations of Yorru removing one piece of the governmental structure in Uqir (really the Basin at large) shouldn't make too much of a ruckus. Any power vacuum would be filled in short order
            >>>> Potentially any considerations for a replacement for Koss might not be neccessary but that still remains to be seen
        >>> Amanda mentioned that she'd only need about 2 days to get the teleporter fixed up

        >>> Hati would pull Sorath to the side and present her with a platinum ring. He wore his already
            >>>> Whatever the rings do, Hati would point out that Sorath is to keep close to him, especially when we venture to the realms of the gods
            >>>> He'd also reiterate that Sorath could face some form of trouble as she's "smelling of the Void" - whatever that means, when they go there.

    >> We climb a, seemingly endless, stairway. Just beneth the summit we meet a Valkyrie.
        >>> She regards us and warns us that the Lord of this Realm is not very sociable and does not seem to want company.
        >>> She tells us of the guardian Kirkfrey has chosen, clearly not happy with that choice and quiet off put
        >>> Kirkfrey has, as of yet, to call for his Valkyries.
    >> Upon reaching the summit we find ourselves in front of a gate. Hati would cringe, as if in pain. At that point Sorath would firmly grasp for his hand. Upon the touch, Hati would immediatly breath a sigh of relief. He said, ever since we entered this realm, he was feeling "sick". And once the two connected, it was gone.
    >> Encounter with Shadavar
        >>> Shadavar was at one point bonded to Aravos, as well.
