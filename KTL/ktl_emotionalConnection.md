Hati, the moment the two of you connect, your mind gets flooded by an onslaught of emotion. What's even more surprising, you realize, these aren't yours. Are these Soraths? You can't really make sense of it all, nor are you able to really focus on any in particular, there is simply too much. Until...

A SURGE
HOPE

You look upon the midnight sun. You've done it! You've bound a rift. Yes, you understand that the price was great, the circumstances in your favor and you still lost the battle against Natal, leading to the opening of the rift in the first place, but you still did it. This is progress. You have the complete ritual, and you managed to perform it. You all did! Additionally, you found the location of the eastern gate, you've defeated the crimson mantle and now you can get Stravos in to further investigate this phenomenon. Your making progress!

Another surge
REGRET

The image shifts. In front of you two Tieflings, man and woman, somewhere in their 40s you reckon. The woman, right in front of you, one arm already around your sholder, the other still across her face in a vain attempt to hide her tears. The face of the man shows a different emotion, yes there is sadness there, but foremost, pride. Your parents, on the day you left them, the day you'd last see them.

A new image. A city scape. The architecture surrounding you not unlike Damvers. In the centre of your view a Tiefling sitting on the side of a well, lute in hand, mid song. Your sister. Shevarra! You hear a tune, the same notes as were played at the entrance to the Uniters tomb. The last time you would ever hear her play...

The music stops and the scene shifts. You are in the middle of a forest. Every single inch of your body hurts. But worse yet, you spot the body of your friend, Nadarr, filled with bullets. Dead. If only you were able to convince him to put his damned name in the book...

Shift again. You're in the desert. You see Hati hanging from the hands of Trevidious, limp, neck seemingly broken. You miscalculated. He did not bluff. You feel a sharp pain in your her heart. You hear Soraths voice: "How do you get off being this stupid, risking HIS life like that. And you felt oh so smart in the moment, didn't you?". More pain, pulsing now, almost like your heart is about to burst.

The pain stops, you're in Wyrmeye Hold. You just figured *something* out, and you just can't hold back. You have to say it out loud. In front of you, you see your friend Kaen, looking like he's about to throw up. You just told Kaen that he is responsible for the death of every single member of the Wyrmeye bloodline. Wasn't enough he had to live with the burden of having killed an entire Family of Dragons. Sorath's voice again "Just put some more pain on him, why don't ya? Learn to shut up sometimes!".

A new image. You look down upon the gate room of Wyrmeye Hold. All your friends are on the floor, knocked out. You see Natal currently rummaging through Voys bag. You feel utterly helpless. Nothing you've done has worked, non of your blasts were able to land and you're out of magic. She's about to do it.

Once more, a surge
HAPPINESS

You look upon Hati, just as you were before the touch. Your hands behind his neck, supporting him. His on your back, supporting you. You could stay like this forever. You've got all you need right here. But you know you'll have to go back to the others. You have things to do, a world to save. But not just yet. You still got some time here, alone with him and you'll make sure you make the best of what you've got left. You move your head closer to his...


Hati, as you open your eyes again, you see Sorath, her face contorted as if in pain. She let's out a sharp "Fuck! [...]"
