I require your sage advice!

So tl;dr I'm thinking of 'retiring' Nephi.

Basically, I wasn't too much of a fan of how last Session played out - it really felt like we were entirely on rails and those rails led to some sort of punishment for something we may have or haven't done - dunno. (Yes, already told Mameer as much).
Now, I'm looking at Nephi's character and I just can't come up with any reasonable rationalization why'd she stick around. She basically lost everything she'd worked for for the last 2 decades and potentially got fucked over by the one real friend she thought she had. And any hope to get even a fraction of it all back, seems far fetched at the moment. Now that she at least has her freedom back (somewhat) - and right now where we left off might be the only chance she has for some time - I'm thinking that she would be the type to go away and start from scratch. 

Idk. Maybe my concept for her just wasn't the right fit for this campaign. By playing into the whole 'mercenary' aspect left me now with basically no connection or regard for the fate of Elpis I feel...
