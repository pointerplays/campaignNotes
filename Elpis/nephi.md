- Foreword

    > I am Nephi. At least, that's the name I've operated under for a couple of years, now. Not sure if this one is just very lucky or I simply adjusted my threshold at which to
    burn a Identity or not. Maybe, I just gotten used to this one too much. I suppose I'll figure that out soon enough.
      
    I never thought I would be someone who started to write down her exploits, given the nature of my prior employment, but after what I have just witnessed, I feel like it is prudent to do so. After all, I did buy this fancy notebook, so might as well use it. Still, I don't feel equiped for anything like this. As much as I love to get lost in stories - be they fictional, historic or anything in between - I've never seen myself as much of a writer. If anything, this shall be the test of just that.

- The Event - 12th of Awakening, 1388

    > It was Venom who turned me on to this job. Part of me wants to think he just wanted to get rid of me for a couple of days, another wants to think he genuinly thinks a change of scenery and some purpose will get me out of my stupor. It's probably the latter and I appreciate his concern. He's a good friend. *However, if you're the one reading this, what I've just commited to paper is a lie and you're stinky.* 

    It was supposed to be a simple job, clear out some freshly opened coal mine from some goblins *that refused to pay rent*. Of course, things didn't quite turn out that way. I suppose hoping for the mistresses' blessing wasn't realistic. The terms of the contract weren't quite right. But I'm getting ahead of myself here.

    It was the late evening of the 11th of Awakening, when I arrived in Lugovik. A quaint little town in the middle of nowhere. Travel, thus far, had been uneventful. While I'd spend most of my time in the city for the past year, or so, traveling the countryside felt oddly refreshing. Maybe V was on to something.
    
    I should have known better and immediatly go to the stables or just camp outside of town, but part of me hoped things would be a little different in this part of the country. After all, the west was were the initial devestation of the revolution hit worst. But, unlike the buildings, the people truly haven't changed. The Inkeep was nice enough when they'd informed me that only their worst room was left to rent, obviously for more than an elf would pay for one in some of the better establishments back in the capital. While I'm usually not a copper pincher, I refuse to get extorted by some yokel. So I choose the stables. It was comfortable enough, at least I had a roof over my head - a luxury I hadn't had in days.
