### "Art" trader

I've also done a little more thinking on this (well, couldn't help myself, really 😅 ):
With an industrial revolution usually also comes a new class of citizen - Factory owners. Usually very rich and politically connected but still often feeling the need to proof themselves in the eyes of old nobility and such. One way to achieve this is of course by hosting lavish parties and showing off their possesions as a indication of their status. Something that's usually is very sought after in this regard is fine art.

So I was thinking maybe "The operative"™️  could pose as a art trader or something like that. Would give a lot of access to high society/the "movers and shakers" and could explain away frequent trips to other nations, like as an example -for no particular reason- Styria. 🙂
